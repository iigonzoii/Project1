        <p>The World's Best Trip Planner was founded in February of 2021.</p>
        <p>Our founders realize how difficult it is to sort through (what seems like) countless online flight-finder platforms.</p>
        <p>Wouldn't it be easier to search through these platforms in one convenient, ad-free location? We thought so too!</p>
        <p>The World's Best Trip Planner is powered by SkyScanner, a company with hundreds of partners all over the world! Therefore, you are always guaranteed to find the lowest price.</p>
        <p>How could it get any better?</p>
        <p>Once you find your dream destination, we will tell you the weather forecast of the first 5 days upon your arrival! Our guests use this tool in order to ensure they're choosing the perfect time to go to the perfect place!</p>
        <p>Thank you for your continued support, and always fly safely.</p>
